# Life hack scripts

Just a few scripts to make your life easier ðŸ¤Ÿ

All these scripts are easily ported over to bash or zsh.

### notify.fish
This script lets you know you have been sitting over your computer for 30 mins and encourages you to move your limbs.

### startup.fish
This script gets called when you login to your session. (You still have to call it though.)
